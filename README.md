- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

If I am developing a program on my own, then I would test as often as possible to ensure proper functionality. Specifically, everytime I added new code into the codebase to catch bugs and defects as early as possible. On a larger project, testers would develop and run unit tests on code to ensure expected results were achieved and the end product is reliable enough for release.

- How do I interpret the users needs and incorporate them into the project?

On larger projects, I would refer to the software requirement documentation that would have already been developed since these have been put in writing. Beyond this, I would break down each requirement into a broader more connected design, that works well and is as extendable as needed. On personal projects, I would list my requirements out into bullet points and tackle each one as needed throughout the process.

- How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software first comes down to the softwares requirements. If this software is being developed for somone else, this will usually be provided and thus I would use these requirements as a guidline for development and testing. Otherwise I would take time to establish what I need my software to be able do, and then follow those requirements.
